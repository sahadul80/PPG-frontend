If you have not paid any of your tuition fees, you will need to show that you have held the full amount in your bank account for 28 consecutive days from the closing balance of your bank statement.\nIf you have paid some of your tuition fees, this will show on your CAS statement, and you will only need to show the remaining amount of fees that you have to pay (If you have paid some of your fees and this is not shown on your CAS, reply to the emailed CAS statement to get this corrected before applying for your visa)\n\nPostgraduate Research Funding\nThere are a number of sources of funding available for graduate Research students. There are Government-backed schemes such as the Professional and Career Development Loans (PCDL), and many private providers offer loans to students that help contribute towards tuition fees and living costs while they study. We would always encourage students to research the full range of options for funding and ensure that they are completely clear about what they are signing up for before they commit.\n\nSources of funding that might be worth investigating include:\n1. www.gov.uk/funding-for-postgraduate-study\n2. www.scholarship-search.org.uk\n3 www.postgraduatestudentships.co.uk\n4. www.prospects.ac.uk/funding_my_further_study\n5. www.turn2us.org.uk\n6. www.dsc.org.uk/FundingWebsites\n7. www.gradfunding.co.uk\n\nProfessional and Career Development Loans (PCDL) are bank loans to pay for courses and training that help with your career or get you into work. You may be able to borrow between £300 and £10,000. Loans are usually offered at a reduced interest rate, and the government pays interest while you’re studying.\nProviders, such as Future Finance, offer loans to cover tuition fees and the costs of living, with variable interest rates depending on your credit history. Loans generally have arrangement fees and may require a guarantor. Repayments may start before you have graduated from your course, and where this is the case, you must ensure that you are able to meet the loan repayments in addition to meeting all of your other course and living costs.\nIn relation to loans, PPG does not endorse or recommend any particular companies or products, and it is important to check all details and terms and conditions before applying for or taking out a loan, ensuring that you are aware of repayment schedules, interest rates, and other charges that might be applied.\n\nLiving Cost\nYou must have a fixed amount of money to cover your living costs. If you will be studying inside London*, you will need £1,265 for each month of your course, up to a maximum of nine months, which will be accounted for at £11,385. This means that if you will be studying in inner London for a course that lasts only one month, the minimum amount that you will need is £1,265.\nIf you will be studying elsewhere (outside London) in the UK, the monthly amounts are lower: you need to have £1,015 for each month of your course, up to a maximum of £9,135 for a course lasting nine months or more.\nThe money must have been in the account for a minimum period of 28 consecutive days up to the date of the closing balance. The account must not have dropped below the amount required at any time during the 28-day period. Also, the final date of this 28-day period must not be more than 31 days before the immigration application is made.\n\n* Inside London is defined as the following London boroughs: Camden; City of London; Hackney; Hammersmith and Fulham; Haringey; Islington; Kensington and Chelsea; Lambeth; Lewisham; Newham; Southwark; Tower Hamlets; Wandsworth; Westminster. You can check which borough your institution is in by entering the postcode of the main study address at aboutmyvote.co.uk If your institution is not in one of the boroughs listed, then you will be studying in outer London or elsewhere in the UK.\n\n*  Pieces of information are collected from the UKCISA official website."

This way, you can reach help quickly if you need it.\nYou are likely to need health and travel insurance. There are many companies specialising in international student insurance. Make sure you are covered if you need to be. Ask your school, college, or university for advice; they may offer a special insurance policy for their students. For information about vaccinations and other health-related considerations, see our Health article.\nCheck with your airline to see what you can bring with you. Most airlines charge for excess baggage.\nLeave plenty of time to check in and pass through security control before boarding connecting flights; there can be long queues.\nIf you need help once you arrive in the UK, ask at an official tourist information office or information desk. There should be one at every airport.\nMake sure you bring warm clothes with you. It might be cold on the trip—or when you arrive! If it’s winter, bring a thick sweater and a warm coat too.\nSecurity at international airports is strict. Find out more about customs restrictions on the gov.uk website, and read the ten tips below to be prepared for border control.\nFor your journey, you may need money for public transport, food, and customs charges. Bring around £200 in travellers’ checks for this. International airports in the UK also have money exchange services and ATMs to withdraw cash in British pound Sterling with a compatible debit or credit card.\nArriving at the airport\n\nWhen you arrive at the airport, follow the signs for ‘Arrivals, unless you are transferring to another plane at the same airport. If you are transferring to another flight, follow the ‘Flight Connections signs.\n\n‘Arrivals’ will take you to passport control. Here, electronic screens will show you where to go; there are usually separate queues for passengers who have passports from the UK, EEA (European Economic Area), or Switzerland and for all other passport holders. Once you have completed the immigration process (see the UKCISA website for more details about immigration and customs), you’ll proceed to the baggage reclaim area to collect your luggage. Look at the screens above the baggage carousels to find your flight number.\n\nFinally, you’ll pass through Customs Control. At UK airports, there are normally three exits through Customs: a green channel if you are travelling from outside the EEA and have nothing to declare; a red channel if you are travelling from outside the EEA and have goods to declare; and a blue channel if you’ve arrived from another airport within the EEA. Follow the links below to check what items should be declared.\n\nThe Border Force (part of the UK government’s Home Office) is responsible for immigration and customs checks at airports. These are Border Force’s top tips for a smooth journey:\n\nHave your passport ready.\nEnsure you complete a landing card if you’re a non-EEA (European Economic Area) national. Landing cards are sometimes given out on the plane, or you can find them in the immigration hall.\nBring details about your course of study. If you have a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number, bring proof of this too.\nKeep any medical documentation, recent bank statements, and details of where you are staying in your hand luggage. You may be asked to show this information.\nDo not bring any meat or dairy products from outside the European Union. There are also restrictions on other food products such as fish, eggs, and honey, as well as some fruit, vegetables, and plants (e.g., bulbs, seeds, cut flowers, and tree bark). You can find out more at https://www.gov.uk/bringing-food-animals-plants-into-uk/food\nThere are restrictions on the amount of tobacco, alcohol, and gifts you can bring to the UK. You can find out more at https://www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods.\nBe aware of your duty-free limit. If you exceed your allowance, you will have to declare it and pay duty at customs (go through the ‘red channel’); otherwise, all of your items may be taken away from you.\nNever bring in counterfeit goods, illegal drugs, weapons, or obscene material. Some items are restricted and will require a licence or permit. You can find out more at www.gov.uk/duty-free-goods/banned-and-restricted-goods.\nYou must declare any sums of cash of €10,000 or more (or the equivalent in another currency) if you are travelling from a country outside the European Union.\nNever give false or misleading information (including forged or counterfeit documents).\nTransport from the airport\n\nWith more than 40 airports plus an extensive network of rail, ferry, and coach links, the UK has an excellent transport system.\n\nYour school, college, or university may arrange to pick you up from the airport when you arrive. If not, aim to arrive during the day, when public transport is more frequent. For trains and buses from the airport, you can save time and money by booking tickets in advance.\n\nYou can find out more about transport options on the airport’s website. For example:\n\nHeathrow Airport\nGatwick Airport\nStansted Airport\nLondon Luton Airport\nManchester Airport\nBirmingham Airport\nEdinburgh Airport\nGlasgow Airport\n\nSee “Travel in the UK” for more information."

For an international student, it is difficult to select a location, price, and a suitable house as well. Moreover, If you would like to share accommodation with someone known or unknown, you must consider whether it is suitable for you or not.\n\nAs a new student in the United Kingdom, if you require temporary accommodation for a short period, please contact us via mail at least two weeks in advance, and we will confirm it soon. Please abide by the citizen advice bureau’s recommendations in order to rent the property:\n\nRenting from a letting agency :\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou can find private landlord-owned housing with the aid of a letting agency. Some will help you simply find accommodation, but many letting agencies manage properties on behalf of landlords, which means that you may have no direct contact with your landlord.\n\nThis fact sheet provides you with information on what charges a letting agency can make and a checklist of questions you should ask before registering with an agency and signing a tenancy agreement.\n\nUsing a letting agency\n\nIt is best to use an agency that is a member of a voluntary self-regulating trade body, as they will require the agency to have a complaints procedure and money protection arrangements. This means that if the agency goes out of business, you will not lose your money.\n\nThe main trade bodies are:\n\nAssociation of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA)\nNational Association of Estate Agents (NAEA)\nRoyal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)\n\nIf the agency is not a member of a trade body, find out whether it participates in a set of standards known as the National Approved Letting Scheme (NALS). These standards include a complaint procedure that you can use. ARLA and NALS are both members of The Property Ombudsman Scheme.\n\nFor contact details of the above organisations, see Further Help. You can also look out for agencies that have the Safe Agent registered mark. This means that your money will be protected through a client money protection scheme. More information is available from the Safe Agent website at www.safeagents.co.uk.\n\nWhat a letting agency cannot charge for:\n\nto register with the agency\nfor a list of properties available for rent.\na deposit that will be returned to you if it does not find you a suitable property.\nIt is a criminal offence for an agency to make these charges. If you have paid any of these charges, you should contact your local council´s Trading Standards Officer or Tenancy Relations Officer, who can take action against the agency.\n\nWhat a letting agency can charge you for\n\nan unlimited fee once you have signed a contract to accept a tenancy. You must have agreed to the tenancy before the agency can charge you.\nAdministration fees\n\nMany agencies will charge you an administration fee. This fee may cover things like the cost of preparing the tenancy agreement, checking references, making up the inventory, and any other costs of setting up the tenancy. Many agencies will charge you for renewing your tenancy agreement once it expires.\n\nIt is best to shop around because not all agencies make these charges, and the amounts can vary between agencies. If you are receiving housing benefits, they will not pay for these fees.\n\nThe agency should provide you with clear information about their charges before you agree to take up a tenancy. Charges should also be reasonable. If you have paid unreasonably high charges or were not given full details of the charges by the agency in advance, you may be able to challenge the charges on the grounds that they are unfair. You should contact a specialist housing adviser or your local council´s trading standards officer for further advice.\n\nA non-returnable holding deposit\n\nThis is charged when you agree to rent a property but have not yet signed the tenancy agreement. This deposit is usually deducted from the security deposit when you move in. You should make sure that you want to take up the tenancy because if you change your mind, your holding deposit will not be returned\n\nThere may be circumstances when you are not able to move into the property for reasons beyond your control; for example, your reference was not satisfactory or the agency has increased the rent. In these circumstances, it may be unfair for the agency not to return your holding deposit. You should seek advice if this happens to you.\n\nIf you have paid an administration fee and/or a holding deposit and the landlord chooses not to go ahead with the tenancy, the Office of Fair Trading Guidance states that you should receive a refund of all pre-payments. If the agency will not return your payments, you should seek advice.\n\n3 Advice guide (Advice that makes a difference)\n\nSecurity deposit:\n\nThis is charged as security against damage to the property or getting into rent arrears. It should be returned to you at the end of your tenancy if you have not breached your tenancy agreement.\n\nAn agent who charges you a security deposit for an assured shorthold tenancy on or after April 6, 2007 must protect it in one of the three government-approved schemes and provide you with details of the scheme.\n\nThe schemes are the Deposit Protection Scheme, the Tenancy Deposit Scheme, and ´my deposits´.\n\nYou should agree with the agent on what condition the property is in when you start renting it, including a list of the furniture and fittings (known as the inventory). This should help stop any disagreements at the end of the tenancy. For more information about security deposits, see Tenancy Deposits in Housing fact sheets.\n\nA checklist of points you should ask the letting agency before registering with them. You should find out the following information from an agency before registering with them to avoid future problems:\n\ndetails of the services it provides\nfull details of the charges it makes.\nwhether it is a member of a trade body such as ARLA, NAEA, RICS, or NALS, as it must have a complaints procedure and protect your money if the agency goes out of business.\nwhether the agency has a complaints procedure and whether it is a member of The Property Ombudsman Scheme.\nDetails of the tenancy deposit protection scheme and its uses\n4 Advice guide\nAdvice that makes a difference\n\nWhether the landlord has the lender´s permission to rent out the property.
